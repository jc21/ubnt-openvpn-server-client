# Edgerouter OpenVPN Server and Client

I'll save you a metric tonne of time.

If you have a Edgerouter X or other models, follow these guides below.

Before you do, you have to make sure you can SSH to your router. If you
don't know how to SSH things, these guides might be a bit too advanced

```bash
# use your router username and password
ssh ubnt@10.0.0.1
```
